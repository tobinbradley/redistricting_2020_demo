# Online Redistricting Demo

This is some demo code for a basic online redistricting app - map, district selection, some rules checking like population balance and contiguity, and a chart. It goes with some [YouTube content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOaPapb-7hU) I made. The tools involved are Svelte, SvelteKit, Maplibre-gl, Turf.js, and Chart.js.
